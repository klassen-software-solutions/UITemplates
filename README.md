# UITemplates
Pixelmator templates for various UI images

The purpose of this project is to contain the starting point for the various image types needed while
writing software, particularly Apple based software.

## License

Note that while this is released under the MIT license, we only consider that applicable to these templates
as starting points. Any images you create using these templates remain your own and do not require any
reference or attribution to us. The only restriction is that you cannot publish the templates themselves and 
restrict their license. (I.e. You cannot stop others from using these templates for their own images.)

## Contributing

Note that this project makes the following changes from our standard procedures:

* There are no development or release branches in this project. Instead you branch your feature branch 
directly from master and when done create a merge request directly back into master.
* There are no unit tests or analysis in this project. After there is no code here, just images.
